# Welcome to my Test Project

This project was developed with the C# programming language (Web API) and Angular.js, 
featuring a responsive layout and API documentation with Swagger, with access via JWT token.

To install and run both projects at once, use the Docker command below. However,

before running the project, make sure to configure your `.env` file by following the examples in the `.env.example` file located in both the frontend and backend directories.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### This command will automatically set up and configure both the backend and frontend. Once that's done, access the project:

Frontend: ```localhost:8080```

Swagger documentation: ```localhost:5000/swagger/index.html```
